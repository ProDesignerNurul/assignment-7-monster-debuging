                <h1>What is the difference between localStorage And sessionStorage</h1> <br>
                <p>Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window. <br> <br>

                  Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page session. <br> <br>
                  
                  Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.</p>

                <h1>What is the difference between Global Scope And Block Scope</h1> <br>
                <p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block: <br> <br>
                  Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope:

                <h1>How Does Work JavScript Event Loop</h1> <br>
                <p>Let's look into JavaScript Event loop from a different angle. Sounds interesting, right? It is! So, sit tight and let's dive into it!
                  The concept of event loop is very simple. But in order to understand that, first we need to be clear about some concepts related to event loop. <br> <br>
                  
                  Inside Browser, there is a Javascript engine (we are considering V8 for chrome.) and an environment to run javascript properly. Javascript engine has two parts, Heap and Call Stack. And the engine has some assistant named Web APIs and Callback Queue.</p>
