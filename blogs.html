                <h1>What is the difference between localStorage And sessionStorage</h1> <br>
                <p>Their main difference is that local storage data does not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the user closes its browser window. <br> <br>

                  Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. So, if a user has three tabs open, each one will have its own page session. <br> <br>
                  
                  Since local storage is not session-based, all the data must be deleted via javascript or manually.</p>

                <h1>What is the difference between Global Scope And Block Scope</h1> <br>
                <p>Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope. ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const. These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript. Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block: <br> <br>
                  Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global Scope:

                <h1>How Does Work JavScript Event Loop</h1> <br>
                <p>Let's look into JavaScript Event loop from a different angle. Sounds interesting, right? It is! So, sit tight and let's dive into it!
                  The concept of event loop is very simple. But in order to understand that, first we need to be clear about some concepts related to event loop. <br> <br>
                  
                  Inside Browser, there is a Javascript engine (we are considering V8 for chrome.) and an environment to run javascript properly. Javascript engine has two parts, Heap and Call Stack. And the engine has some assistant named Web APIs and Callback Queue.</p>

                <h1>What is undefined And Typeof undefined</h1> <br>
                <p> undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

                  In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)
                  
                  A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. <br>  <br>
                  Strict equality and undefined
                  You can use undefined and the strict equality and inequality operators to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable x is not initialized, and the if statement evaluates to true. <br> <br>
                  typeof operator and undefined
                  Alternatively, typeof can be used <br>
                  However, there is another alternative. JavaScript is a statically scoped language, so knowing if a variable is declared can be read by seeing whether it is declared in an enclosing context.

                  The global scope is bound to the global object, so checking the existence of a variable in the global context can be done by checking the existence of a property on the global object, using the in operator, for instance: 
                  void operator and undefined
                  The void operator is a third alternative. <br>
